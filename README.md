<h1>PathFinder</h1>

<h2>What is this </h2>
<p>This project is a python game that shows you the process of the a* path finding algorithm.</p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>
<p>The application is built in python using a library called pygame. The reason I went with pygame is it gave me an easy way to visually display the steps taken in the a* algorithm to find the shortest path.</p>

<h2>What is the purpose of this</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with a popular classical algorithm and brush up on my python and object oriented design skills.</p>

<h2>Current features</h2>
<p>You can place obstacles by clicking anywhere on the board, you can place start and destination points by selecting either button and clicking on the board. To visualize the pathfinding process press the "Visualize path" button. The reset button resets the board to its original empty state.</p>

<h2>Future improvements</h2>
<p>I could clean up the UI some more to make the buttons more reactive aswell as adding more classical pathfinding algorithms for visualization.</p>
